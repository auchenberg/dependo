dependo
===========

Visualize your CommonJS, AMD, or ES6 module dependencies in a force directed graph report - powered by [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).

**NEW MAINTAINER WANTED**: This project hasn't been maintained in while, so if you wanna help out, please let me know!

Introduction
-------------

Let me introduce dependo - A small visualization tool that draws an force directed graph of JavaScript dependencies pulled from a codebase of
CommonJS, AMD, or ES6. Behind the scene Iâ€™m using a wonderful library named [node-madge](https://github.com/pahen/node-madge/), to extract the dependencies and combined with the power of [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) I draw a beautiful zoomable directed graph.


You can read the full introduction to the project in my [blog post](http://blog.kenneth.io/blog/2013/04/01/visualize-your-javaScript-dependencies-with-dependo/).

Features
-------------
- Draw a graph of nodes, where each module is represented as a node.
- Google Maps's like zooming, dragging and panning.
- Connect nodes with it's dependencies via lines.
- Hovering a node will highlight it's direct dependencies.
- It's possible to drag a node to a specific position, to re-layout the graph.

Report example
-------

The best way to show something is by example, so here I generated a graph of the official RequireJS [multipage](https://github.com/requirejs/example-multipage) example:

See the example here: http://auchenberg.github.com/dependo/example

Installation
------------
To install as a library:

    $ npm install dependo

To install the command-line tool:

    $ sudo npm -g install dependo

Options
---

```JavaScript
{
    'format': The module format to expect, 'cjs', 'amd', 'es6', or 'json'. AMD (amd) is the default format. If 'json', pass a file formatted like `example.json` in the `example/` directory.
    'optimized': Boolean, True if the parser should read modules from a optimized file (r.js). Defaults to false.
    'exclude': String from which a regex will be constructed for excluding files from the scan.
    'mainRequireModule': Name of the module if parsing an optimized file (r.js), where the main file used require() instead of define. Defaults to ''.
    'requireConfig': Path to RequireJS config used to find shim dependencies and path aliases. Not used by default.
    'reverse': Reverse dependency arrow directions.
    'title': The title of the generated HTML document.
}
```

API
---
```JavaScript

  var Dependo = require('dependo');

  // Fire up an dependo instance
  var dependo = new Dependo(src, {
    format: 'amd',
    requireConfig: 'optional path to RequireJS config file',
    exclude: '^node_modules',
    transform: function(dep){
        //Apply a transformation on dependencies
        ....

        return dep;

    }
  });

  dependo.generateHtml();
  ...
```

CLI
---
    Usage: dependo [options] <file|dir ...>

    Options:

      -h, --help              output usage information
      -V, --version           output the version number
      -f, --format <name>     format to parse (amd/cjs/es6/json)
      -x, --exclude <regex>   a regular expression for excluding modules
      -t, --title <title>     the title of the generated document (dependo)
      -l, --layout <filename> load a previously saved layout (json)
      -v, --reverse           reverse direction of arrows

### Generate HTML report of all module dependencies (AMD), and save it to /example/report.html

    $ dependo -f amd /path/src > example/report.html

Grunt
-----
I also wrote a grunt-task that can be found in this separate repository: https://github.com/auchenberg/grunt-dependo

Roadmap
-------
dependo is still very much in progress, so here is the todo-list:

- Proper label positioning: Avoid label collisions and make the graph more readable.
- Testing! Unit tests of D3 render logic, and the grunt-task itself

Thanks to
-----------
This project wouldn't have been possible without the great work on [node-madge](https://github.com/pahen/node-madge/) by Patrik Henningson, or wonderful [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) library.
